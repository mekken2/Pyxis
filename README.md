# Problem Statement
App/portal for tracking/finding of missing persons/children by use of Aadhaar enabled Biometric details

# Overview of the Project
A deep learning model that will assist the passive search process by providing an Interface to input details of a person to scan/search for in the CIDR database. It also provides on demand, regulated access of information only to authorized personnel/ department

# Our Approach

# Operation

* An interface which allows you to input details ( pic,name etc) of an individual, it then runs a search through the cidr database, to obtain complete details of the person. 
* To provide a regulated, on demand access to each authority or personnel in need of the information, this system is to prevent mishandling of sensitive data
* Linking all the CCTV cameras of the locality where the person got missing, running Face recognition on the CCTV footage to  identify a person
* Some traffickers use adv to attract victims or messages to communicate with them. Any such textual piece of lead found is stored in a real time database and a mechanism to find links between similar ads, messages etc is instilled
